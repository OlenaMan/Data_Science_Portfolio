# Data_Science_Portfolio
## Data Analytics · Machine Learning · Exploratory Analysis

Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio, a collection of hands-on projects demonstrating practical skills in data analytics, machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualisation, and Python, SQL programming.
This repository highlights my ability to work with real-world datasets, uncover insights, build predictive models, and communicate results clearly and professionally.

The portfolio includes work completed as part of the Imperial College London & HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp as well as independent projects expanding my analytical and modelling capabilities.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each project includes:

- A structured Jupyter Notebook or Python code with clear workflow

- README documentation explaining the problem, approach, and results

- Visualisations to communicate findings

- Machine learning models where applicable

## Project Categories
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning, feature exploration, featuer engineering, statistical summaries, visual storytelling.

2️⃣ Machine Learning Models

Regression, classification, feature engineering, model evaluation, insight extraction.

3️⃣ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Sentiment analysis, text classification, sequential neural networks.

4️⃣ SQL & Python Projects
