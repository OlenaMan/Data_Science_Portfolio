## Bookstore Inventory Tracking (SQL-Focused)
### Overview

This project demonstrates a practical SQL-driven inventory tracking system implemented through Python. It focuses on relational data modeling, SQL queries, and CRUD operations, using Python as a lightweight interface layer.

The project simulates a small bookstore inventory workflow and emphasizes structured data management over application complexity.

### Business Context

Retail inventory accuracy is essential for stock control and operational efficiency. Structured databases enable consistent tracking, querying, and updating of inventory records while reducing manual errors.

This project models how a relational database can support basic inventory management in a retail setting.

### What I Did

- Designed a relational schema for bookstore inventory

- Created and managed tables using SQL

- Implemented CRUD operations via SQL queries

- Integrated Python as a control layer for database interaction

- Queried inventory data to retrieve and update records

- Applied basic validation to preserve data consistency

### Key Skills Demonstrated

- SQL database design

- Relational data modeling

- CRUD operations

- SQL querying and updates

- Python–SQL integration

- Defensive data handling

### Technologies Used

- SQL (SQLite)

- Python

- SQLite database engine

### Results (High Level)

- Inventory records can be created, updated, queried, and removed reliably

- SQL provides clear, structured access to inventory data

- Python enables programmatic control without obscuring database logic

- Demonstrates strengths and limits of lightweight relational systems
