## Ames Housing Price Prediction

## Multiple Linear Regression (Python)

### Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Multiple Linear Regression workflow to predict residential property sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset. It highlights practical data analysis, model development, evaluation, and interpretation skills required for entry data science and data analytics roles 

### Business Context

Accurately estimating property values is essential for pricing strategy, investment analysis, and risk assessment. This project explores how structural home features influence sale price and evaluates how well a linear model can explain those relationships.

### What I Did

- Explored housing data to identify relevant numerical predictors

- Selected and prepared features for modeling

- Built a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn

- Evaluated performance using train/test split and regression metrics

- Interpreted model coefficients to explain feature impact

- Assessed residuals to validate model assumptions

### Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and feature selection

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Multiple Linear Regression

- Model evaluation and validation

- Statistical interpretation of results

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

### Dataset

Based on the Ames Housing dataset (Dean De Cock, 2011), a widely used real-world dataset for regression modeling.
Only numerical features were used to maintain interpretability and focus on linear relationships.

### Results (High Level)

- The model captures a meaningful portion of sale price variance

- Living area and basement size show strong positive influence

- Results illustrate both the strengths and limitations of linear models in pricing problems

(Exact metrics and diagnostics are available in the notebook.)
