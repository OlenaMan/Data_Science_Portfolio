## Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Automobile dataset to understand how different vehicle characteristics,
such as, engine size, horsepower, body style, and fuel consumption - relate to market price.

The analysis focuses on uncovering key patterns, identifying outliers, and exploring correlations that help explain pricing behavior across different categories of cars.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository — Automobile Dataset

- **Rows**: 205

- **Features**: 26 (mixture of numeric and categorical variables)

- **Topics covered**: Pricing, performance metrics, vehicle design attributes

The dataset includes a variety of car specifications such as make, fuel type, number of doors, body style, horsepower, engine size, MPG, and price
— making it highly suitable for multivariate exploratory analysis.

## EDA Workflow

The analysis includes the following key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- Handling missing values in numeric and categorical features

- Converting data types for consistency

- Normalising and rounding numerical fields

- Removing or flagging anomalies for further inspection

2. **Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**

- Summary statistics to understand central tendencies and variability

- Visual exploration of price, horsepower, and engine size

- Histograms and bar charts for categorical variables

3. **Correlation & Relationship Analysis**

- Heatmaps to identify strongest numeric correlations

- Scatter plots to visualise relationships between price and fuel economy 

- Pairplots to examine how price varies across body styles, horsepower and engine size

4. **Categorical Feature Exploration**

- Comparing price distributions across:

  - Fuel types

  - Body styles

## Key Insights

- Price strongly correlates with engine size and horsepower. 

- Engine capacity varies significantly by brand, with premium manufacturers prioritising performance over fuel economy.

- Expensive cars generally consume more fuel, while cheaper models are more efficient.

- Fuel economy shows a strong negative correlation with price: higher-priced vehicles tend to have worse MPG.
